description: "sorcery, the practice of malevolent magic, derived from casting lots\
  \ as a means of divining the future in the ancient Mediterranean world. Some scholars\
  \ distinguish sorcery from witchcraft by noting that it is learned rather than intrinsic.\
  \ Other scholars, noting that modern witches claim to learn their craft, suggest\
  \ that sorcery\u2019s intent is always evil and that of witchcraft can be either\
  \ good or bad. In the early Christian era, the term was applied to any magician\
  \ or wizard but by the Middle Ages only to those who allegedly practiced magic intended\
  \ to harm others. In Western popular culture, and in Western children\u2019s literature\
  \ in particular, the sorcerer often assumes a more positive guise."
