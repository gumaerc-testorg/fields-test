  title: High Speed Communication Circuits
description: magic, a concept used to describe a mode of rationality or way of thinking
  that looks to invisible forces to influence events, effect change in material conditions,
  or present the illusion of change. Within the Western tradition, this way of thinking
  is distinct from religious or scientific modes; however, such distinctions and even
  the definition of magic are subject to wide debate. Practices classified as magic
  include divination, astrology, incantations, alchemy, sorcery, spirit mediation,
  and necromancy.
