description: witchcraft, traditionally, the exercise or invocation of alleged supernatural
  powers to control people or events, practices typically involving sorcery or magic.
  Although defined differently in disparate historical and cultural contexts, witchcraft
  has often been seen, especially in the West, as the work of crones who meet secretly
  at night, indulge in cannibalism and orgiastic rites with the Devil, or Satan, and
  perform black magic. Witchcraft thus defined exists more in the imagination of contemporaries
  than in any objective reality.
